Why I have this here:
I have this script here because I had to help a group of engineers in an org I worked at be able 
to consistently and correctly mount their personal drives to save data and pull images to remote 
hosts and we had an issue with typos so this is the user friendly version.

Script Title
This is a shell script that mounts a Windows share server using CIFS or WebDAV.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you get the script up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You need to have the following software installed:
Bash shell
CIFS or WebDAV client, depending on your choice
